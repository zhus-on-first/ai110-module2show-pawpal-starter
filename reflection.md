# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

The three core actions a user can take in the app are:

- Entering owner and pet information
- Adding/editing care tasks with durations and priorities
- Viewing and managing a prioritized daily care schedule based on the entered information and tasks

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

1. `Owner`: Represents the pet owner. Responsible for managing the collection of pets.

    Attributes:
    - `name: str`
    - `pets: list[Pet]`

    Methods:
    - `add_pet(pet: Pet)`
    - `remove_pet(name: str)`
    - `get_all_tasks() -> list[Task]`

2. `Pet`: Represents a pet belonging to an owner. Stores pet details and its associated care tasks.

    Attributes:
    - `name: str`
    - `species: str`
    - `tasks: list[Task]`

    Methods:
    - `add_task(task: Task)`
    - `remove_task(name: str)`

3. `Task`: Represents a single care activity. Uses a dataclass for clean attribute management.

    Attributes:
    - `name: str`
    - `time: str`
    - `duration: int`
    - `frequency: str`
    - `priority: str`
    - `completed: bool`

    Methods: `mark_complete()`

4. `Scheduler`: The system's brain. Retrieves tasks across all pets and applies algorithmic logic to organize them.

    Attributes: `owner: Owner`

    Methods:
    - `get_all_tasks() -> list[Task]`
    - `sort_by_time() -> list[Task]`
    - `filter_by_status(completed: bool) -> list[Task]`
    - `detect_conflicts() -> list[str]`
    - `handle_recurring_tasks()`

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.
---

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

---

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
